NOTES
- save files are in ~/Library/Application Support/LOVE on OSX

late-night notes:
* all of these should probably come after you get the normal puzzle rooms finalized. all fine-tuning and gravy, in other words
x rearrange shirts a little numerically. move black to near end, shift colors down
- Fashion Lab is a real company, but something like that sounds good for the company name
- blocks in hub rooms! if you want. could make a good tutorial, kinda? basic moving of blocks?
- move office to right side of F1, exit just north of it
- add new door tiles to actor chipset (stairs, "LAB")
- basement w/ computer, takes shirts, gives final shirt
  - or takes "materials", maybe all 26 things required
  - ...A...(missing)...C
    ...D...E...(missing)
  	...G...H...I
  	...(missing)...(missing)...(missing)
  	etc
- final shirt is what allows you to walk through walls?
- normal ending and good ending?
  - own computer has a hidden message that gets decoded as you find materials with matching letters: FIND THE DEAD PIXEL
  - one dead pixel somewhere in building; finding it = good ending?
  * or dead pixel is in your office, but that message is somewhere else in the building. maybe computers in other floors' lobbies w/ messages?
    - hints about hard-to-get shirts, like white which is semi-hidden
4x 2x2 notes on floor, maybe remote table in middle
- argh, move doors again for nice squareness? :/
final task at top floor (5th), but then traps on the way back down? final trial, kinda
16 notes + 9 shirts + ? = 26 research materials. can give each a letter of the alphabet?
- maybe even name them all interestingly/humorously
- shirts = BCGMRWY + "D"ark? "V"oid? "N"ull? "U"ncolored?
GO TO SLEEP

other letters because i can't sleep:
- make text arrays that can be referenced from multiple places. noteA = {"foo","bar"}, noteB = ..., etc
* don't forget: reset reminder ("Room stability"?), pause reminder ("Knowledge panel"?), mute reminder ("Noise reduction"?)
  - and these should not give the player the choice. just "let's take a look", while the others offer the choice to read the text or not
A animal test results? acceleration due to gravity
D domesticated animal warning, "never use on a horse"? durability testing? digital matter experimentation (general)?
E embroidery?
F funding? fiber something? friction? food (hallucinogenic effects)?
H * "hidden stuff, such as in this room (20)"?
I 
J jewelry?
K? kinetic something? "vs potential energy conservation"?
L light reflection? "glowing, indeed, even in the dark"
N? *
O organic matter interaction?
P pants "subjects' legs were foreverially dressed up digitized against their will and loving it"? haha. "...the hell? did a child write this?"
Q quilting patterns "test subjects liked _ and _, and christine agrees that the _ looks quite nice as a throw."
R *
S sewing patterns? soil removal? stain removal? sex appeal?
T textile something? tensile strength
U? uncolored?
V? vegetable fiber adhesion or interaction
X xxx fashion applications? x-ray vision susceptibility? "officially, no difference from other materials, however FBI very interested"
Z zoological interaction survey? zipping/zippers?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXME
- blow up block assets
- save player settings (zoom, music)
- add 100* notes to 200* notes

revised endgame plan because you got too ambitious
- exit door has 3 possible behaviors:
  1. need more notes: "i can't leave yet! gotta collect the stuff!"
	2. got notes, missing shirts: "did i get everything? whatever, i guess i should get out of here. (player confirms)" -> credits
	3. got everything: "whew, that was a mental workout. time to finally go home!" -> credits with permanent starry background!

TODO in order of importance
! a row of computers in the lobby that each give a different control hint. screw the notes thing.
  - "There's a document open on this computer. It says..."
  * one comp standing apart that tracks your progress. "floor 1... all notes collected" "floor 2... 2/4 notes collected" "special material Y... missing"
	  - wait, is this hard? lol. #lazy
- make basement with final cutscenes? ...nope, make a copy of your office (with blocks!), that's where final shirt is given if you have all the stuff
  - or not? just computer bank in lobby, instead?
- top floor with endgame cutscenes, also
  - maybe a person in a locked room? need final shirt to reach him?
- clean up elevator UI
- giant cleanup of comments and stuff
- shirts + progress on pause menu
  * or just mention shirt controls at progress-tracking comp in lobby
! change text on block inspection
! finish blowing up assets
- swap out all those EXIT doors for regular doors
- ...and put in an actual exit door, lol
! credits/ending somehow. heh :/
- change debug keys (123) to something else. maybe: ,./
  - and show to player on their computer in endgame! "you're so thorough, here's debug mode" maybe with a "did i turn everything off?" hint at the exit
	- or just leave a note in the credits :)
- zoom that works with Windows? :/
- evaluateAndSkip1IfTrue for more dynamic scripts? still so hacky, there's got to be a simple, good way to do it :/
  * call it "branch"? i still think this will be a valuable script tool!
> postgame fun: all black backgrounds turn into twinkly stars
  = an anikey, a big graphic, sprite batches (i guess) & draw logic in main, some collectible flag?
? "white warp" for room resets?
	
at this point, no:
> better story/cutscenes & effects (like a quake or a siren or a red flash)
- level editor? lol
- fade music in/out a little more nicely? hmm
- more still actors for decoration?
	- wall paintings
	- garbage cans
? collectible color controls? start with only RGB? hmmm. kind of a distant stretch goal at this point...
> colorblind mode?
? powerups that clear all of one color? heh, not this time. oh, well


credits:
* post in Love forums (and others?) when game is complete :)
  - and FB and twitter and maybe ello?
- (song name & artist), jamendo.com
- sfx actually: sfxr/cfxr http://thirdcog.eu/apps/cfxr


done TODOs
! actually label rooms/doors...? OR remove the prompt, it's kind of unneeded
  * actually just remove the prompt from puzzle room ENTRY, leave on exit
- better control hints, esp at startup + remote
! maybe control tweaks? Q -> remote?
  - tap to turn on remote when not using :)
	- Q to turn off remote
! final audio: stairs, doors (, item collection, bips for remote)
  - maybe also a siren for cutscenes?
- finish making elevator
- animated (?) fusion key that can be pulled up again :/ on K? [did not animate, but it looks better and can be toggled]
- can do prettier fading trick when blocks fuse, i think... maybe try #2 will go better
- debug mode by holding down a key or three? walk through walls?
> collectible shirts? change colors with tab when not controlling blocks? lol
  - clear shirt is reward for hardest puzzle? kinda ultimate reward?
! more puzzles, obvs. would like ~15 total
  - 4~6 "baby" puzzles, the rest semi-hard
! arrange loot nicely
! rearrange puzzle rooms
  - maybe gate the upper floors? hm
	- label puzzle rooms?
- change all instances of "gigapixel" to "megapixel"
! SAVE player's body parts
- let player choose hero? lol
! shirt controls 
- text box icon? x_x
! place reminders for controls on pause screen
! what happens in windows when you press Z?
	* it is broken in windows and i assume non-retina macs. could change to non-high-dpi and only zoom by 2?
> let player choose from 3 sprites, M/F/neutral
  * different skin tones, too?
	* and different hair colors?
	- glasses?
	* more art will be required, but it might actually be pretty easy?
	- could have a special menu where player presses tab to generate a new random character, enter when satisfied
- save after intro cutscene
! less shitty title screen, maybe animated
  - maybe only appears when a save file exists. new game = jump right in
! what to do when there's no save file and they hit continue (new game!)
! audio
	- collide, collect, door, stairs?, elevator?
  - bg music
		* ability to pause music for cutscenes
	- ending/title music?
x save other stuff in save files (zoom and stuff)
