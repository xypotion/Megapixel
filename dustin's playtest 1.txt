dustin's playthrough of 0.2 on 9/7/2015

in his own words:
escape to cancel - give a warning first
"bump" noise when you collide with a wall comes a little too late
not an autosave when you manually save
hot keys for each color to hold down and then move those colors with the arrow keys
use RETURN for interractions instead
Z won't toggle screen size when in other menus
quick check hot key for which notes you have without going to first floor
* reloading from save does not remember screen size preference
  - separate, non-player-specific data file for this? heh
- translucent remote display over a 4th floor room looks weird

complaints/suggestions:
- escape is too vulnerable
- remote controls are still cumbersome. maybe use number keys!
  - and then maybe shirt-changing can just happen on the pause menu?
- SPACE is a cumbersome interaction button. maybe enter
- zoom only working sometimes is weird...
- some desire to finish puzzles "perfectly", i.e. clearing rooms 100%. worth thinking about? ehhh
- hard to remember what the opposites of colors are
- way to check progress outside of first floor would be nice. (pause screen = acceptable)
- still hates magenta-shirt puzzle; hotkeys would be especially good there
  - like really, really hates. getting the magenta shirt was the hardest puzzle for him. consider moving to 4th floor?
- "battery"/"barrier" puzzle also pretty hard (3-NE)
- remote display in tetris room is annoying
- continue from last save would be better than from last autosave

praise:
- liked my art assets, i guess!
- good dialogue/interaction in opening cutscenes. he actually laughed at my silly writing :o
- likes shirts :P
- liked white room puzzle

things he didn't do/notice:
- blocks in office after opening cutscene
- color key (until instructed)
- mute (until instructed)
* didn't reset with R when instructed in 1-NE! (make this hint more explicit; clarify that it resets your position, doesn't reset items)
- more button presses to speed up dialogue
- walking into walls for sfx (whatever)

bugs + things I noticed:
- floor 1 NE room: add some desks?
- definitely prompt to exit game on escape; test with other menus...
- puzzles still taking longer than expected. maybe too hard :S
- zoom works on windows!! whew. looks good on his screen, even.
* bug: picking up shirts beeps twice?
- shift-tab ability still not clear enough. won't matter if you change the control scheme though....
x bug: magenta shirt calls itself red shirt when found
- do you reset to wearing a grey shirt after loading game?
- maybe save K (color key) state
* 3f has office gap on left side still
- blue shirt puzzle room is a little too easy, maybe
- old battery/barrier puzzle is pretty hard
- he studied the diamond-faucet puzzle for a long time. 
- was surprised that floor 1 had a secret ;) (good) and looked in "A" room (also good)
- getting yellow shirt in painting room just as challenging as i thought

x = fixed/addressed
